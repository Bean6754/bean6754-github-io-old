    <h1>Group Policy</h1>
    <p>There are two types of Group Policy in Windows Server. <b>Local</b> Group Policy and <b>Domain</b> Group Policy.</p>
    <p><b>Local</b> Group Policy is used for local only policies. So policies are only able to be applied to a specific machine and cannot be easily managed.</p>
    <p><b>Domain</b> Group Policy uses the same policies (and more!) as Local Group Policy, except it is to be ran on an Active Directory server, with Users and Computers.</p>
    <h2>Features of Domain Group Policy over Local Group Policy.</h2>
    <p><b>Domain</b> Group Policy can be:</p>
    <p>Managed from one central server.</p>
    <p>Can do drive mapping.</p>
    <p>Can do registry key management.</p>
    <p>Can do software managment.</p>
    <p>Can list and choose from forests inside of a domain.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A forest is a way to group and divide on a domain. So that you can have multiple instances of Active Directory be separate on the same domain.</p>
